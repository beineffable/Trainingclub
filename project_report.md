# Ineffable Training Club - Website Upgrade Project Report

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the website upgrade project for Ineffable Training Club. The project involved analyzing the current website, creating a comprehensive upgrade plan, implementing key components, testing functionality, and preparing deployment documentation. The upgraded website delivers a premium, high-performance platform that supports exclusive membership functionality, access code systems, and a high-end user experience that reflects the brand's identity.

## Project Overview

### Current Website Analysis
The original website (www.trainingclub.ch) hosted on Wix was a basic landing page with limited functionality and navigation issues. Menu items led to 404 errors, and the site lacked the membership and booking systems required for the business model.

Based on detailed requirements provided, the upgraded website needed to include:
1. Exclusive membership model with standard and elite tiers
2. Access code system for new member registration
3. Referral program integration
4. Members-only area with booking capabilities
5. Credit management and holiday flexibility features
6. Premium design reflecting the brand's high-performance identity

### Implementation Approach
After evaluating platform options, WordPress was recommended as the optimal solution for balancing functionality, customization, and cost-effectiveness. Due to technical limitations in the development environment, we created comprehensive HTML/CSS templates and JavaScript functionality that can be implemented in a production WordPress environment using the provided implementation guide.
